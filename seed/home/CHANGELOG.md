# AgentOS changelog

What changed upstream, written for the agent that merges it into a machine
(see `skills/update/SKILL.md`). Newest first. Each entry: what and why, the
files, and **If you changed this**: how to carry the idea over when this
machine has its own version of those files.

## 2026-10-09 · Agent-run updates

- **What:** this file, `bin/agentos-upstream`, `skills/update/SKILL.md`, the
  weekly `jobs/agentos-update` job, and `LOCAL.md` (how this machine differs
  from stock). AGENTS.md has a new "Updates" section.
- **Why:** each machine is the owner's own fork; its agent keeps it current by
  merging upstream with judgment instead of the owner doing merges.
- **If you changed this:** keep your job schedule; take the skill and script.

## 2026-10-09 · Chat stops flashing while streaming

- **What:** `ui.morph(el, html)` in `ui/kit.js` updates only nodes that changed.
  `app/thread.js` (timeline turns, header, working line, approvals, composer
  footer) and `app/main.js` (nav, Views, chat list) use it instead of innerHTML.
- **Why:** every streamed chunk recreated every icon and restarted every
  animation (259 icons recreated in one short chat, now 7).
- **If you changed this:** use `ui.morph` anywhere your version re-renders on
  live updates. Don't morph an element the owner is typing in.

## 2026-10-09 · Current chat adapters, effort picker

- **What:** `agents/agents.json` uses `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp`
  (command `claude-agent-acp`) and `@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp`; the old
  `@zed-industries/*` packages are deprecated and their model lists frozen.
  agentd prefers the adapter's `model` config option, adds `options.effort`
  (thought_level) with `PATCH /threads/:id {effort}`, an `effort` column, and
  Codex's full mode `agent-full-access`. The composer has an effort picker.
- **Migration (run once):** `npm rm -g @zed-industries/claude-code-acp @zed-industries/codex-acp; npm i -g @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp @agentclientprotocol/codex-acp`,
  then restart agentd (scheduled, see the skill).
- **If you changed this:** keep your agents.json additions; update the `acp`
  and `acpInstall` fields of claude and codex.

## 2026-10-09 · Agent logos, no icon backgrounds

- **What:** `ui/logos.svg` and `ui.agentMark(id, name)`; letter circles replaced
  in the composer, pickers, thread header and Settings. Icons never sit on a
  tile or chip (DESIGN.md rule); `.conn-icon`, `.tile-icon`, `.need-icon` are plain.
- **If you changed this:** the owner asked for plain icons; respect that in your version.

## 2026-10-09 · Sign in with GitHub

- **What:** Connections can sign in with a service's own CLI (catalog
  `signin`: needs, install, command, test, after, logout). GitHub uses
  `gh auth login --web`; the Desk relays the device code. Backups include
  `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml` and `~/.gitconfig`.
- **If you changed this:** merge the `signin` block into your catalog's github entry.

## 2026-10-09 · Files

- **What:** the Files View (`views/files/`), the Desk's files API
  (`views/desk/files.mjs`), kit helpers `ui.codeBlock`, `ui.editor`,
  `ui.document`, `ui.highlight` with vendored libraries in `ui/vendor/`,
  `desk.context()` / `desk.discuss()`, `show <file>[:line]`, Ctrl P.
- **If you changed this:** Files is a system View; keep it in the sidebar's NAV.
